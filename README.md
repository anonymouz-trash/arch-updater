# Arch Linux Updater Script

This is a try to fully automate the Arch Linux maintainance and get a more knowledge of how Arch Linux works.
My setup:  Arch Linux (ofc ^^), KDE Desktop (sometimes GNOME) and AMD (Desktop) / Nvidia (Laptop) graphics.

Feel free to use any of the code in this repo for your own.
I highly encourage you to read through the script before you using it!
As you know: No backup, no mercy. ;)

# Prerequisite
- yay           (AUR-Helper)
- debtap        (for installing *.deb-packages)
- reflector     (Updating Arch mirrorlist)

All programs will be installed automatically if not available.

# Changelog
v2.5:
- code design, erased useless stuff

v2.0 released :D :
- ditched dialog as TUI
- created an even simplier menu just with echo and case in a do-while-loop
- full rewrite
- re-organize categories & assets
- make it more KISS

# Disclaimer

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!!

I'm not responsible for any damage and I highly recommend to see through the entire project/code before using it!
The whole project is adjusted to my needs.
